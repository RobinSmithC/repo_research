The PDF file contains both the R code and output (including plots). This is to be used to evaluate the Rmd file which produced the result. The PDF would not generate from RStudio. This was overcome by generating HTML and then printing to PDF. I am using Linux and to troubleshoot the issue would be time consuming and thefore a work around was executed in order to meet deadlines.


The Rmd file was not initially submitted with the PDF. This was later done.
